## Code review
I'm new to React so any performance improvements that can be made will be appreciated as pull requests. All React-specific stuff is located in [`assets/scripts/src/`](https://github.com/jshjohnson/NumberRush/tree/master/assets/scripts/src)

### To do:
* ~~Add unit tests~~
* Refactor css
* Experiment with Redux/Flux for state handling 

### Credits:
I felt inspired to build this as a result of [this](http://jnjosh.com/posts/learning-german-with-AVSpeechUtterance/) article. Note to self: Blog more!
